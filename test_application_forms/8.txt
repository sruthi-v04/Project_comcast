The generation of KYC number/identifier will be performed by the Bank subject to availability of necessary technology.
Clarification/Guidelines on filling details for CRS purposes.
Reason A: The country/region where I am liable to pay tax does not issue TINs to its residents.
Reason B: The accountholder is otherwise unable to obtain a TIN or equivalent number. (Please explain why you are unable to obtain a TIN in the below table if you
have selected this reason.)
Reason C: No TIN is required.
(Note: Only select this reason if the authorities of the jurisdiction of tax residence entered in the table do not require the TIN to be disclosed.)
Appendix – Definitions
Note: These are selected definitions provided to assist you with the completion of this form. Further details can be found within the Income Tax Rules, 1961 and
OECD Common Reporting Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (the CRS), the associated commentary to the CRS, and domestic
guidance. This can be found at the following link www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/
If you have any questions then please contact your tax adviser or domestic tax authority.
Tax Identification Number (TIN): TIN (including functional equivalent) – The term TIN means Taxpayer Identification Number assigned to a person in the country/
territory in which he is resident for tax purposes and includes a functional equivalent in case no such number is assigned. A TIN is a unique combination of letters
or numbers assigned by a jurisdiction to an individual or an Entity and used to identify the individual or Entity for the purposes of administering the tax laws of such
jurisdiction. Further details of acceptable TINs can be found at the following link:
www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/
Some jurisdictions do not issue a TIN. However, these jurisdictions often utilise some other high integrity number with an equivalent level of identification (a functional
equivalent). Examples of that type of number include, for individuals, a social security/insurance number, citizen/personal identification/service code/number, and
resident registration number, PAN (Permanent Account number) and resident registration number.)
Accountholder – The term ‘accountholder’ means the person listed or identified as the holder of a Financial Account by the financial institution that maintains the account.
CKYCR – Central KYC Registry.
Controlling Person – This is a natural person who exercises control over an Entity and includes a beneficial owner as determined under sub-rule (3) of rule 9 of the Prevention
of Money-Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005.
In determining the beneficial owner, the procedure specified in the following circular as amended from time to time shall be applied, namely:
i. DBOD.AML.BC. No.71/14.01.001/2012-13, issued on 18 January 2013 by the Reserve Bank of India; or
ii. CIR/MIRSD/2/2013, issued on 24 January 2013 by the Securities and Exchange Board of India; or
iii. IRDA/SDD/GDL/CIR/019/02/2013, issued on 4 February 2013 by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority.
In the case of a trust, the Controlling Person means the settlor, the trustees, the protector (if any), the beneficiaries or class of beneficiaries, and any other natural person
exercising ultimate effective control over the trust, and in the case of a legal arrangement other than a trust, the said expression means the person in equivalent or similar
position.
Where an Entity accountholder is treated as a Passive Non-Financial Entity (NFE) then a Financial Institution must determine whether such Controlling Persons are Reportable
Persons. If the account is maintained for an Entity of which the individual is a Controlling Person, then the ‘Controlling Person tax residency self-certification’ form should be
completed instead of this form.
Entity – The term ‘Entity’ means a legal person or a legal arrangement, such as a corporation, organisation, partnership, trust or foundation.
FATCA – Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
Financial Account – A ‘Financial Account’ is an account maintained by a Financial Institution and includes: Depository Accounts; Custodial Accounts; Equity and Debt
interest in certain Investment Entities; Cash Value Insurance Contracts; and Annuity Contracts.
Reportable Account – The term ‘Reportable Account’ means an account held by one or more Reportable Persons or by a Passive NFE with one or more Controlling Persons
that is a Reportable Person (relevant extract for CRS).
Reportable Person
Reportable person means,
(a) one or more persons other than,
i. a corporation, the stock of which is regularly traded on one or more established securities markets;
ii. any corporation that is a related Entity of a corporation mentioned in item (i);
iii. a Governmental Entity;
iv. an International organization;
v. a Central bank; or
vi. a financial institution,

a resident of any country/territory outside India (except the United States of America) under the tax laws of such country/territory; (relevant extract for CRS).
Dual resident individuals may rely on the tiebreaker rules contained in tax conventions (if applicable) to solve cases of double residence for purposes of determining their
residence for tax purposes.

cards extend a host of offers ranging from travel privileges to dining, shopping and more.
Please visit the credit cards section of our website www.hsbc.co.in for more details on:
Lost card liability and how to reduce the chances of your credit card being subject to misuse
Transaction fee and applicable interest for cash advances against your credit card, finance charge (interest) in case the credit card outstanding is not repaid
in full by the due date
You need to pay the minimum payment due (you may choose to pay higher) by the payment due date specified on your monthly card statement to avoid transactions
getting declined and levy of late payment fee.
Making only the minimum payment every month would result in the repayment stretching over years with consequent interest payment on your outstanding balance.
Please refer to Most Important Terms and Conditions (MITC) on www.hsbc.co.in
You need to pay at least your minimum due amount by the due date. Non-payment would impact:
- Your credit rating (reporting to Credit Information Companies)

- In addition to the above, the Bank can cancel the credit limit and initiate recovery proceedings to recover the dues

Cardholders can get up to 45 or 48 days free credit(depending upon the card type) without any finance charge levied to the credit card account. This is
applicable provided the credit card outstanding, as shown on monthly credit card statement, is settled fully by the payment due date. However, the free
credit period will not be applicable for Cash Advance transactions.

e)

Finance charges
•
Cardholders can avail of the ‘extended credit facility’ by paying the Minimum Payment Due (MPD) indicated in the monthly credit card statement. 		
The MPD is calculated as 5% of the total payment due of the statement plus greater of Past Due amount or Overlimit amount (if any). Interest will 		
be charged on the extended credit as per terms and conditions
•
If Cardholders avail of the extended credit facility by paying an amount less than the statement closing balance, the entire outstanding amount will
attract a finance charge from the respective date of transaction at the prevailing rate. All new transactions will also attract a finance charge from the
respective date of transaction
•
All cash advance transactions will attract a finance charge at the prevailing rate from the date of withdrawal until the entire amount along with the
charges are cleared
•
Finance charges are computed from date of transaction at the prevailing rate mentioned in the or at such modified rates as decided by 		
Bank from time to time
Late payment fee
Late payment fee (Charged if the minimum amount due is not credited in the card by the payment due date) is 100% of the Minimum Payment Due (MPD)Subject to minimum fees of `250 and maximum fees of `1,200 per month. Please note that the Late Payment Fees is levied only if the Minimum Payment
Due is not paid by the due date.

f)

Illustrative examples of how Late Payment Charges are calculated Assume you receive a statement for the period 16 October - 15 November, with a payment due date of 7 December. Payment of Minimum Payment Due
(MPD) is required to be received in the card account by the payment due date (7 December) to ensure that no late payment fees are levied. Late payment
fees will be levied as per the illustration in the table given below:
MPD (`) Late payment charges (`) Description
`100

`250

100% of MPD i.e. on `100 is `100. Since the minimum fee is `250, the late payment fee levied will be `250.

`250

`250

100% of MPD i.e. on `250 is `250, hence the late payment fees levied would be `250.

`500

`500

100% of MPD, i.e. `500 is `500, hence the late payment fees levied would be `500.

`1,500

`1,200

100% of MPD, i.e. on `1,500 is `1,500. However since maximum fee applicable is `1,200, the late payment fee
levied would be `1,200.

2.

CREDIT LIMITS
•
The credit limit and cash withdrawal limit (Up to 20% of credit limit or as decided by the Bank from time to time) are communicated to you in your
monthly card statement. The available credit limit is provided as part of the monthly statement. The Bank reserves its right to reduce the credit limit.

account is funded fully or partly
•

3.

BILLING AND PAYMENTS
a) With effect from 05 August 2013 we wish to inform that the payment allocation logic (i.e. ’Payment Hierarchy’) towards payment made to the 		
credit card account is being revised. In the revised ‘Payment Hierarchy’, allocation will first happen to the extent of Minimum Payment Due, first by
the following ‘plans’ i.e. EMI, cash advances, purchase outstanding and balance transfer in descending order of interest rates, and within a given 		
‘plan’, the payment will be allocated in a predefined order of (1) Service Charges, (2) Finance Charges, (3) Late payment charges (4) Annual fee and
(5) Other fees. The excess payment (if any) over and above minimum payment due will be allocated in same hierarchy as defined above.
b) When the credit card account has an outstanding balance, HSBC will send a monthly itemised statement of account at the mailing address 		

indicating the payments credited and the transactions debited to the Cardholder’s account since the last statement. Non-receipt of statement would
not affect the Cardholder’s obligations and liabilities.
c) Cardholders may choose to pay only the Minimum Payment Due, as printed on the statement, and such payment should be sent before the 		
payment due date, which is also printed on the statement. If payment is made by cheque, the funds must be realised in the card account by the 		
due date. The outstandings carried forward will attract a finance charge at the prevailing rate mentioned in the or as decided by the 			
Bank from time to time.
d) Cardholders can choose from following modes of payment to settle monthly dues:
		
• Cheque/draft payment: The cheque/draft should be made payable to ‘HSBC A/c No. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX’ (mention cardholders’ 16-digit 		
		
credit card number).
			
Cheque/draft payment can be submitted at:
			
Drop-boxes at HSBC Branches/ATMs in India (visit www.hsbc.co.in for a complete list of branches and ATMs)
			
Skypak drop-boxes (visit www.hsbc.co.in for a list of Skypak drop-boxes located close to you)
			
Mail to The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, Clearing Department, M G Road, Fort, Mumbai - 400 001
		
• Cash Payment: Cash payments can be made at any HSBC Branch in India
		
• Standing Instruction: If the Cardholder is an accountholder with HSBC, he/she can issue a standing instruction for transferring funds from the
		
Cardholder’s HSBC account to credit card account
		
• Internet Banking: Cardholder can pay bills online conveniently by logging onto HSBC Personal Internet Banking*
		
*Option available for HSBC accountholders only.
		
• ECS: Cardholders can make payment directly by authorising HSBC to debit a Cardholder’s account with any Bank. This facility is available only
		
in Mumbai and Delhi.
		
• Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT): You can make a payment towards your credit card account via NEFT, mentioning the complete 16-digit credit
		
card number.
		
• ATM/PhoneBanking: Cardholder can access their account with HSBC through ATM/PhoneBanking facility for making payments against credit
		
card outstandings
e) Billing disputes resolution:
		
• The Cardholder is deemed to have received each statement of account for the preceding month, either on actual receipt of the statement of 		
		
account or 10 days after the dispatch of the statement of account by the Bank, whichever is earlier (prescribed period). Upon receipt of each 		
		
statement of account and in any event not more than 30 (thirty) days from the period mentioned above, the Cardholder agrees to immediately
		
notify the Bank in writing of any errors, omissions, irregularities, including any fraudulent or unauthorised transactions or any other objections
		
the Cardholder has to that statement of account. If the Cardholder fails to notify the Bank within 30 (thirty) days, the statement of account 		
		
and all entries therein, will be conclusive evidence of the correctness of the contents and binding upon the Cardholder and/or any person 		
		
claiming under or through such Cardholder without the requirement for any further proof and the Bank will be released from all liability 		
		
for any transaction (including all charges, damages and losses of any kind whatsoever, taxes, levies, fines, fees or penalties suffered and/		
		
or incurred) occurring up to the date of the most recent statement of account, except for transactions the Cardholder gave notice of in 		
		
accordance with this section
		
• For reporting billing discrepancies, Cardholders can either call the customer service centre (numbers are provided on the reverse of the monthly
		
statement or at www.hsbc.co.in) or write to HSBC Credit Card Division, Dispute Desk, P. O. Box 5080, Chennai - 600 028
